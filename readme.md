1. cài đặt ruby. Có thể gặp vấn đề về network

2. cài đặt rail

3. cài đặt mysql2

sẽ gặp vấn đề: thiếu thư viên msys2, download tại đây https://www.msys2.org/

vì đã sử dụng mysql của xampp, cho nên phải chạy câu lệnh sau: gem install mysql2 -- --with-mysql-dir=C:\xampp\mysql

`gem install mysql2 -- --with-mysql-dir=C:\xampp\mysql` sẽ tiếp tục lỗi do thiếu 2 thư mục: lib, include

trong file config/database.yml

thêm

development:
adapter: mysql2
encoding: utf8
database: test
username: root
password:
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 3306

#development:
#  <<: *default
